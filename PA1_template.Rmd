We will use tools from these two R packages.
```{r, result=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
```

### Import 'activity' dataset
  We want to transform **date** to a time data type and call it **day**. Then the data frame table used for   analysis below will be "activity".
```{r Import dataset}
mydf <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Data Science - Coursera/Reproducible Research 2015/activity.csv")
tbl_df(mydf)
activity <- mutate(tbl_df(mydf), day = ymd(date))
activity <- select(activity, steps, interval, day)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day? 
  For this part of the assignment, we ignore the missing values in the dataset.The mean number of steps is 10766 steps.
```{r}
by_day <- group_by(activity, day)
monthly_walking_pattern <- summarize(by_day, daily_total=sum(steps))
```


### 1. Histogram 
```{r}

hist(monthly_walking_pattern$daily_total, xlab= 'Daily Total Steps',main = 'Total Number of Steps taken Each Day')

```

### 2. Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.
```{r}
summarize(monthly_walking_pattern, average = mean(daily_total, na.rm=TRUE), median = median(daily_total, na.rm = TRUE))
```

##What is the average daily activity pattern?

###1. Time Series Plot 

```{r, echo=TRUE}
by_interval <- group_by(activity, interval)
daily_walking_pattern <- summarize(by_interval, Number_of_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
plot(daily_walking_pattern, type = 'l', xlab = '5-Minute Interval', ylab = 'Ave Steps Taken')
```

###2. Maximum *activity* at 8:35AM
  The 5-minute interval corresponding to around 8:35 AM - average across all the days in the dataset - contains the maximum number of steps: approximately 206 steps.

```{r}
filter(daily_walking_pattern, Number_of_Steps == max(Number_of_Steps))
```

##Imputing missing values

###1. 2304 rows of missing data 
  The plot shows the missing data resides in 8 days across two months. 288*8=2304

```{r}
missing <- filter(activity, is.na(steps)==TRUE) 
missing
miss_data<- summarize(by_day, count=n(), missing_int = sum(is.na(steps)))
plot(miss_data$day,miss_data$missing_int, ylab = 'Number of Missing Rows', xlab='Date')
```

###2. Strategy for filling in the missing values
  We will use the **mean number of steps for the corresponding 5-minute** interval to impute the missing values. The complete dataset will be named *activity_imputed*.


```{r}
fill_with <- summarize(by_interval, Number_of_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
activity_imputed <- activity
i=1
while( i <= nrow(missing))
{   
  missing[i,1] = fill_with[which(fill_with$interval==as.numeric(missing[i,2])),2]
  i= i+1
}

activity_imputed[is.na(activity$steps),1] = missing[,1]
activity_imputed
summary(activity_imputed)

```


### Revised analysis with imputed dataset.
  Using the imputed dataset, we see that the **mean** and the **median** daily total number of steps are the same. This was not the case with the missing data. Filling in the missing values with the average has made the distribution of *steps* across *intervals* more symmetric, i.e., less skewed.

```{r}
by_day <- group_by(activity_imputed, day)
monthly_walking_pattern_imputed <- summarize(by_day, daily_total=sum(steps))
hist(monthly_walking_pattern_imputed$daily_total, xlab= 'Daily Total Steps',main = 'Total Number of Steps taken Each Day (imputed data)')
summarize(monthly_walking_pattern_imputed, average = mean(daily_total), median = median(daily_total))
```


###Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
  Comparison of the two time series plots below shows that, on the weekends, there are more *activity* through out the 24 hours period. 
```{r}

activity_imputed <- mutate(activity_imputed, weekend = weekdays(day)=="Sunday"|weekdays(day)=="Saturday")
summary(activity_imputed)
weekend_days <- filter(activity_imputed, weekend == TRUE)
weekday_days <- filter(activity_imputed, weekend == FALSE)

by_interval_weekend_days <- group_by(weekend_days,interval)
by_interval_weekday_days <- group_by(weekday_days,interval)

weekend_plot <- summarize(by_interval_weekend_days, number_of_steps = mean(steps) )
weekday_plot <- summarize(by_interval_weekday_days, number_of_steps = mean(steps))


par(mfrow=c(2,1))
plot(weekend_plot$interval, weekend_plot$number_of_steps, type = 'l', xlab = 'Interval', ylab = 'Number of Steps', main = 'Weekend')
plot(weekday_plot$interval, weekday_plot$number_of_steps, type = 'l', xlab = 'Interval', ylab = 'Number of Steps', main = 'Weekdays')

```
